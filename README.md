**Project No.01 Titanic Survival Exploration with Decision Trees**


**Fllow the steps.......**

**Step 1. Load the titanic .csv file**
\nWe'll start by loading the dataset and displaying some of its rows.

**Step 2. Preprocessing the data**
Now, let's do some data preprocessing. First, we'll one-hot encode the features.
Using code: "features = pd.get_dummies(features_raw)"

**Step 3. Split data in to training and testing**

Using by importing train_test_split class from sklearn.model_selection

**Step 4. Predicting the future value**

**Step 5. Find accuracy**
