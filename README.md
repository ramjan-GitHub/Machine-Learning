Now, let's do some data preprocessing. First, we'll one-hot encode the features.

Using code: "features = pd.get_dummies(features_raw)"


**Step 3. Split data in to training and testing**

Using by importing train_test_split class from sklearn.model_selection


**Step 4. Predicting the future value**



**Step 5. Find accuracy**

Note:- To know in details open notebook (.ipynb) file in Anaconda.
